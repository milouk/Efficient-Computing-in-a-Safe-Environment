	abstract = {In this work we examine how the updates addressing Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities impact the performance of HPC applications. To study this we use the application kernel module of XDMoD to test the performance before and after the application of the vulnerability patches. We tested the performance difference for multiple application and benchmarks including: NWChem, NAMD, HPCC, IOR, MDTest and IMB. The results show that although some specific functions can have performance decreased by as much as 74\%, the majority of individual metrics indicates little to no decrease in performance. The real-world applications show a 2-3\% decrease in performance for single node jobs and a 5-11\% decrease for parallel multi node jobs.},

	abstract = {Green Mining is a field of MSR that studies software energy consumption and relies on software performance data. Unfortunately there is a severe lack of publicly available software power use performance data. This means that green mining researchers must generate this data themselves by writing tests, building multiple revisions of a product, and then running these tests multiple times (10+) for each software revision while measuring power use. Then, they must aggregate these measurements to estimate the energy consumed by the tests for each software revision. This is time consuming and is made more difficult by the constraints of mobile devices and their OSes. In this paper we propose, implement, and demonstrate Green Miner: the first dedicated hardware mining software repositories testbed. The Green Miner physically measures the energy consumption of mobile devices (Android phones) and automates the testing of applications, and the reporting of measurements back to developers and researchers. The Green Miner has already produced valuable results for commercial Android application developers, and has been shown to replicate other power studies' results.},
